Today, I’d like to talk about my hobby. My hobby is reading science fictions, like the Three-body Problem. Science fictions are always attractive to me, because they can not only give me science knowledge, but they are also very interesting. 

My favorite science-fiction writers are Wang Jinkang and Liu Cixin. Their styles are different but very brilliant.

Wang Jinkang was born in 1948, so his life shows the common ups and downs of the generation of the cultural revolution. Because of his experiences, his works contain his own understanding of life, which is desolate and solemn, but the keynote of his works is positive and self-confident, reflecting the great national spirit. 

Almost everyone knows Liu Cixin. He is the most popular science-fiction writer in China and he has created many fantastic works. His most famous fiction is the Three-body Problem, which has brought Chinese science fictions to the world level.

Now, I want to ask you a question. How many of you have read the Three-body Problem? It’s my favorite book, so I’d like to talk a bit more about it. It has three parts: Remembrance of Earth’s Past, the Dark Forest and Death's End. As for me, the most impressive plot is the end of Death’s End. 

Now please close your eyes and imagine. There is only one glass ball floating in the micro universe. Within it, a golden fish is swimming through the algae, under the man-made light. Just at that moment, a drop of dew falls off the algae leaf, shining crystally in the space. 

Maybe you’re thinking now: Will the universe continue? Will life go on? 

The story indicates that the man-made light is not only light, but something that can lighten people’s hearts as well. This fiction leads us to the reflections on the ultimate meaning of the universe. It is really a great work.

This is my hobby, reading science fictions. How about yours? 

Thanks for your listening.
